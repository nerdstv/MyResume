# My Resume

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my resume. It is maintained solely by me, ensuring that only I can make edits. All changes are tracked via Git, allowing for a complete version history.

## Overview

- **Source**: LaTeX files for my resume (e.g., `resume.tex`).
- **Version Control**: Git is used to manage every update, so each version is archived.
- **Compilation**: The resume can be compiled to PDF using LaTeX. A GitHub Action is also set up to automatically compile the document upon each push.
- **Access**: Only the repository owner (me) can make changes. No external contributions or pull requests are accepted.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine (read-only for reference):
